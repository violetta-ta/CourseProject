# CourseProject

The project for Text Classification Competition from the team "The West Coasters":

Tirthankar	Bhakta		tbhakta2@illinois.edu <br />
Marina		Polupanova	marinap2@illinois.edu <br />
Savita		Manghnani	savitam2@illinois.edu <br />

We planed to classify tweets to predict the ones which can be qualified as sarcasm using following methods:<br />
    • Random Forest <br />
    • Logistic Regression <br />
    • Support Vector Machine <br />
    • Recurrent Neural Network <br />

Instead, after feedback on the Project Proposal submission, we used following methods:

    • LSTM 
    • DNN Classifier with DAN sentence encoder  (hit the LiveDataLab threshold). Please note, that in the demo video we have told that we use Transformer sentence encoder, but in fact the one which hit the performance baseline was DAN sentence encoder, and it is posted in the dnn.py file. 
    • Multi-channel CNN model
    • BERT
