# CourseProject

The project for Text Classification Competition from the team "The West Coasters":

Tirthankar	Bhakta		tbhakta2@illinois.edu <br />
Marina		Polupanova	marinap2@illinois.edu <br />
Savita		Manghnani	savitam2@illinois.edu <br />

We planed to classify tweets to predict the ones which can be qualified as sarcasm using following methods:<br />
    • Random Forest <br />
    • Logistic Regression <br />
    • Support Vector Machine <br />
    • Recurrent Neural Network <br />

Instead, after feedback on the Project Proposal submission, we used following methods:

    • LSTM 
    • DNN Classifier (hit the LiveDataLab threshold)
    • Multi-channel CNN model
    • BERT
